title:  Classification of Galaxies, Stars, and Quasars from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17 Using Different Machine Learning Techniques
summary: We worked with a specific chunk of data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 17. Using machine learning models, we aimed to accurately classify stars, galaxies, and quasars (QSO). We applied a total of 15 different machine learning models to our dataset and then applied a voting classifier as an ensemble technique. Finally, we were able to increase our classification accuracy to 98.36%. We also highlighted comparing our research with a previous study on the same dataset, which had an accuracy of 98%.
