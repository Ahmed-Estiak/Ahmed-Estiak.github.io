title: Talking Planets- Astronomy Educational App Development
summary: Awarded Astronomy for Development Grants funded by Office of Astronomy for Development of the International Astronomical Union for this astronomy education related project. I am the leader and project coordinator of this project. You can download our developed app from the Google PlayStore. It is an android application with 12 characters (8 planets of our solar system, Sun, our Moon, Europa, and IO). A user can chat with these characters to  know their mass, temperature, size, type, sky color, etc. The characters will behave like  chatbots with the user.
