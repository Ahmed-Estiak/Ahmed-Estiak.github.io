title: Talking Planets- Astronomy Educational App Development
summary: Awarded Astronomy for Development Grants funded by Office of Astronomy for Development of
the International Astronomical Union for this astronomy education related project. I am the leader and project coordinator of this project. You can download our developed app by following this link- `https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.talking.planets`. It’s an android application with 12 characters (8 planets of our solar system, Sun, our Moon, Europa, and IO). A user can chat with these characters to  know their mass, temperature, size, type, sky color, etc. The characters will behave like  chatbots with the user.
